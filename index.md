# Projects

## [Jagora](https://github.com/twsswt/jagora)

Agent Oriented Market Simulation Framework, implemented in Java

## [The Theatre of Agents](https://git.dcs.gla.ac.uk/sts-sim/theatre_ag)

A Python based environment for multi-agent simulations, with a particular focus on modelling socio-technical systems.
Theatre_Ag is designed to enable experimenters to specify readable workflows directly as collections of related methods 
organised into Plain Old Python Classes that are executed by the agents in the simulation.  All other simulation machinery 
(critically task duration and clock synchronization) is handled internally by the simulation environment.

## [ASP](https://git.dcs.gla.ac.uk/sts-sim/asp)

An Aspect Oriented Programming Library for Python.

## [PyDySoFu](https://git.dcs.gla.ac.uk/sts-sim/pydysofu)

A library for fuzzing Python functions at runtime.
